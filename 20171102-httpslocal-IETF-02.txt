  Certificate Transparency (CT)
<Abstract>
  This document defines a new HTTP header, named Expect-CT, that allows
  web host operators to instruct user agents to expect valid Signed
  Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) to be served on connections to these
  hosts.  When configured in enforcement mode, user agents (UAs) will
  remember that hosts expect SCTs and will refuse connections that do
  not conform to the UA's Certificate Transparency policy.  When
  configured in report-only mode, UAs will report the lack of valid
  SCTs to a URI configured by the host, but will allow the connection.
  By turning on Expect-CT, web host operators can discover
  misconfigurations in their Certificate Transparency deployments and
  ensure that misissued certificates accepted by UAs are discoverable
  in Certificate Transparency logs.

  service discovery, device authentication
<Abstract>
  This document proposes a device pairing mechanism that establishes a
  relation between two devices by agreeing on a secret and manually
  verifying the secret's authenticity using an SAS (short
  authentication string).  Pairing has to be performed only once per
  pair of devices, as for a re-discovery at any later point in time,
  the exchanged secret can be used for mutual authentication.

  The proposed pairing method is suited for each application area where
  human operated devices need to establish a relation that allows
  configurationless and privacy preserving re-discovery at any later
  point in time.  Since privacy preserving applications are the main
  suitors, we especially care about privacy.

<Abstract>
  This document discusses issues and problems occuring in the design of

  pairing systems and general user interaction requirements to make the
  case for "short authentication strings".  It then reviews the design
  of cryptographic algorithms designed to maximise the robustness of
  the short authentication string mechanisms, as well as implementation
  considerations such as integration with TLS.

  localnet pki bootstrap
<Abstract>
  This document specifies automated bootstrapping of a remote secure
  key infrastructure (BRSKI) using vendor installed X.509 certificate,
  in combination with a vendor's authorizing service, both online and
  offline.  Bootstrapping a new device can occur using a routable
  address and a cloud service, or using only link-local connectivity,
  or on limited/disconnected networks.  Support for lower security
  models, including devices with minimal identity, is described for
  legacy reasons but not encouraged.  Bootstrapping is complete when
  the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is
  successfully deployed to the device but the established secure
  connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the
  device as well.

  localnet top level domain name
<Abstract>
  This document updates RFC6761 with the goal of ensuring that
  "localhost" can be safely relied upon as a name for the local host's
  loopback interface.  To that end, stub resolvers are required to
  resolve localhost names to loopback addresses.  Recursive DNS servers
  are required to return "NXDOMAIN" when queried for localhost names,
  making non-conformant stub resolvers more likely to fail and produce
  problem reports that result in updates.

  Together, these requirements would allow applications and
  specifications to join regular users in drawing the common-sense
  conclusions that "localhost" means "localhost", and doesn't resolve
  to somewhere else on the network.

  device authentication, device authorization
<Abstract>
  Constrained devices are nodes with limited processing power, storage
  space, and transmission capacities.  In many cases, these devices do
  not provide user interfaces, and they are often intended to interact
  without human intervention.

  This document includes a collection of representative use cases for
  authentication and authorization in constrained environments.  These
  use cases aim at identifying authorization problems that arise during
  the life cycle of a constrained device and are intended to provide a
  guideline for developing a comprehensive authentication and
  authorization solution for this class of scenarios.

  Where specific details are relevant, it is assumed that the devices
  use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) as a communication
  protocol.  However, most conclusions apply generally.

  certificate issuance mechanism
<Abstract>
  Certificates in PKI using X.509 (PKIX) are used for a number of
  purposes, the most significant of which is the authentication of
  domain names.  Thus, certificate authorities in the Web PKI are
  trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately
  represents the domain name(s) in the certificate.  Today, this
  verification is done through a collection of ad hoc mechanisms.  This
  document describes a protocol that a certification authority (CA) and
  an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and
  certificate issuance.  The protocol also provides facilities for
  other certificate management functions, such as certificate
  revocation.

  certificate issuance mechanism
<Abstract>
  The CAA DNS record allows a domain to communicate issuance policy to
  CAs, but only allows a domain to define policy with CA-level
  granularity.  However, the CAA specification also provides facilities
  for extension to admit more granular, CA-specific policy.  This
  specification defines two such parameters, one allowing specific
  accounts of a CA to be identified by URI and one allowing specific
  methods of domain control validation as defined by the ACME protocol
  to be required.

  This memo proposes an ACME extension to enable the issuance of short-

  while retaining the capability to cancel this delegation at any time
  with no need to rely on certificate revocation mechanisms.

  short-term certificate, localnet
<Abstract>
  This memo proposes a protocol that allows a domain name owner to
  delegate to a third party (such as a CDN) control over a certificate
  that bears one or more names in that domain.  Specifically the third
  party creates a Certificate Signing Request for the domain, which can
  then be used by the domain owner to request a short term and
  automatically renewed (STAR) certificate.

  This is a component in a solution where a third-party such as a CDN
  can terminate TLS sessions on behalf of a domain name owner (e.g., a
  content provider), and the domain owner can cancel this delegation at
  any time without having to rely on certificate revocation mechanisms.

  This draft describes a new TLS extension for transport of a DNS

  authenticate that record set.  The intent of this proposal is to
  allow TLS clients to perform DANE authentication of a TLS server
  without needing to perform additional DNS record lookups.  It will
  typically not be used for general DNSSEC validation of TLS endpoint
  names.

<Abstract>
  Unlike earlier versions of TLS, current drafts of TLS 1.3 have
  instead adopted ephemeral-mode Diffie-Hellman and elliptic-curve
  Diffie-Hellman as the primary cryptographic key exchange mechanism
  used in TLS.  This document describes an optional configuration for
  TLS servers that allows for the use of a static Diffie-Hellman
  private key for all TLS connections made to the server.  Passive
  monitoring of TLS connections can be enabled by installing a
  corresponding copy of this key in each monitoring device.

  The organizational separation between the operator of a TLS server

  problems, for example when it comes to reducing the lifetime of
  certificates or supporting new cryptographic algorithms.  This
  document describes a mechanism to allow TLS server operators to
  create their own credential delegations without breaking
  compatibility with clients that do not support this specification.

<Abstract>
  This document presents a taxonomy of a set of "Alternative Network
  Deployments" that emerged in the last decade with the aim of bringing
  Internet connectivity to people or providing a local communication
  infrastructure to serve various complementary needs and objectives.
  They employ architectures and topologies different from those of
  mainstream networks and rely on alternative governance and business
  models.

  The document also surveys the technologies deployed in these
  networks, and their differing architectural characteristics,
  including a set of definitions and shared properties.

  The classification considers models such as Community Networks,
  Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs), networks owned by
  individuals but leased out to network operators who use them as a
  low-cost medium to reach the underserved population, networks that
  provide connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users, and
  rural utility cooperatives.
