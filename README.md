# Use Cases

In this repository we would like to collect use cases where browsers communicate with web-server-capable
via HTTP and/or WebSocket over TLS, for the purpose of clarifying network and security requirements.

If you find another use case, please submit a Pull Request to add it to [UseCases.md](UseCases.md), or add your comment
to relevant GitHub issues.

The following are the documents derived from the discussions on the use cases. Please also add your comment on the documents.

* [Requirement.md](Requirement.md) - functional and non-functional requirements of HTTPS in local network
* [RelevantSpec.md](RelevantSpec.md) - existing specifications and drafts relevant to HTTPS in local network
* [Certificate.md](Certificate.md) - types of server certificate used for HTTPS in local network
